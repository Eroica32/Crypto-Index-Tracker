# Crypto-Index-Tracker
I made this program to track the top 21 non-stable crypto currencies with the largest market capitalizations. This program receives coin information from the Coin Market Cap API, cleans it, and calculates the percentage of each coin in the index fund in relation to the total market cap of the 21 coins. 

Input: 
1. the amount of capital that I am willing to invest in my index fund. ($2000 CAD in this case)

returns: 
1. a csv file with updated information on the 21 coins.
2. a csv file with the amount that I should invest for each coin to achieve desired index proportion. (also printed out in the terminal)
3. a pie chart visualization of return #2.

Next steps to the Development:
1. make my csv store historical data
2. Put getSymbol() somewhere else
3. fix inefficiency (readability and code efficiency)
4. improved visualization
5. improve UI
